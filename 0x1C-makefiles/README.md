# Makefiles

Project completed during **Fullstack Software Engineering** program at **ALX**. It aims to learn what are makefiles, when, why and how to use them (with variables, explicit and implicit rules).

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash
* C files are compiled using `gcc`
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Version of `make`: GNU Make 3.81
